# VIN Decoder

A python ttkbootstrap application that decodes Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) using the NHTSA's Vehicle Product Information Catalog API. This tool is particularly useful for automotive professionals as it provides comprehensive vehicle information with a special focus on safety systems and features.

The application organizes the decoded information into three main sections:
- Basic vehicle details (year, make, model, manufacturer)
- Safety features and equipment (airbags, driver assistance, crash avoidance systems)
- Complete vehicle specifications

Data is retrieved from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's public database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date vehicle information.
